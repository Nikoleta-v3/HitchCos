Welcome to listwiz's documentation!
===================================

In this documentation you will find information about the `listwiz` project.
`listwiz` allows you to handle lists: sort them, find the longest increasing
streaks, and identify the most frequently occurring elements::

    >>> import listwiz
    >>> # Example with the implemented function.


The purpose of this package is to help you learn how to contribute to open
source projects. The documentation has two main parts. These are the guidelines
to contributing and a set of examples of the `listwiz` functions:
