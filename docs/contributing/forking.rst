.. _Forking:

1. Forking and Cloning the repository
-------------------------------------

Forking the repository
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Most projects have protected GitHub repositories, meaning you cannot make
changes directly to the source code. Instead, you need to create a copy of the
source code under your own GitHub account and then make changes to that copy.
This process is called a **fork**. To do this, navigate to the GitHub repository
of the project
(https://github.com/Nikoleta-v3/HitchCos)
and click the :code:`Fork` button. Then choose your GitHub account as the
**onwer** and click on :code:`Create fork`.

Cloning the repository
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once we have a fork of the repository on **your** Github account, create a copy
of it to your computer. This is called cloning. Do this by clicking the
:code:`Code` button and copying the address of the repository to your clipboard:

Note that we want to copy the address of the repository using the `SSH`
protocol. Now, open your command line tool and type `git clone`, then paste the
address you just copied. The command should look like the following, where
`<your-username>` is replaced with your GitHub username::


    $ git clone git@github.com:Nikoleta-v3/HitchCos.git

This will download the source code to your computer::
